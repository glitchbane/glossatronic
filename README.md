Glossatronic is software that supports the creation of a generic glossary of terms by domain, which can be translated into one or more other languages.

At this time, simply read the Wiki for more information.  This is a nascent project.

To run the client:

run npm install from the glossatronic root directory: npm install
start the app: ng serve (the app will run by default on port 4200)

To run the api:

run pm install from the src/api directory: npm install
start the app: npm start (the api will run by default on port 3500)
